# Blog-Project

the destinationMailID const in the app.js has to be changed to the mail which must recieve all the mails sent through the nodemailer.




for Mailing feature, initialise a .env file in the root director with two fields, 

MAIL_USERNAME=____      
MAIL_PASSWORD=____

#in the blank for username, use your yahoo mail id for ex. name@yahoo.com
#In the blank for password, go into your yahoo account -> account info -> account security -> (create an app password over here, thus, this can be used in the blank!)
